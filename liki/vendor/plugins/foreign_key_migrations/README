= foreign_key_migrations plugin for ActiveRecord

Allows foreign keys to be specified in ActiveRecord migrations. Foreign keys 
via this plugin are currently supported for the following database adapters:

* MySQL
* PostgreSQL
* SQLite
* SQLite3

Foreign keys can be specified in three ways, modeled on indexes.

* In a column definition:

    class AddUsersTable < ActiveRecord::Migration
    
      def self.up
        create_table :users do |t|
          t.column :department_id, :integer, :references => :departments
        end
      end
      
    end
    
* In a table definition:

    class AddUsersTable < ActiveRecord::Migration

      def self.up
        create_table :users do |t|
          t.column :department_id, :integer
          t.foreign_key :on => :department_id, :references => :departments
        end
      end
  
    end

    
* Or outside a table definition:

    class AddUsersTable < ActiveRecord::Migration

      def self.up
        create_table :users do |t|
          t.column :department_id, :integer
        end
        
        add_foreign_key :on => :users, :references => :departments
      end
  
    end
    
Foreign keys can be more complex to deal with non-Rails or legacy databases, 
such as:

    add_foreign_key 
        :on => {:table => :users, :column => :dept_id}, 
        :references => {:table => :departments, :column => :dept_id}
